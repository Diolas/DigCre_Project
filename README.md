# DigCre_Project

This is the readme file for a project in the module **Digital Creativity** at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. The goal of this project is to visualize piano learning progress using AI-generated images based on MIDI data captured from piano practice sessions.

---

## Idea

The initial idea for this project is to use MIDI data recorded during piano practice to create visual representations of learning progress. By analyzing and interpreting the musical data, the AI will generate unique images that reflect the performance's emotion, complexity, and structure. *(Write more details here later.)*

---

## Implementation

The project implementation involves capturing MIDI data from a keyboard, processing the data for visualization, and using AI tools to create the images. The process is iterative, with each stage refining the approach to ensure the visualizations effectively convey the desired aspects of learning progress. *(Add more details here as needed.)*

---

## First Iteration

- Captured MIDI data from basic piano exercises.
- Used simple AI models to generate abstract images.
- Tested various visualization styles to understand what works best.

### Code Files
The following code files are part of this iteration:

1. [midi_capture.py](Python%20Code/midi_capture.py) - Script for capturing MIDI data.
2. [image_generator.py](Python%20Code/image_generator.py) - AI model for generating images.
3. [data_processing.py](Python%20Code/data_processing.py) - Preprocessing MIDI data for visualization.


---

## Second Iteration

- Improved data preprocessing to include velocity and timing nuances.
- Experimented with different AI visualization tools to create more expressive and detailed images.
- Added comparisons to show how progress evolves over time.
